        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to enable communication between clients and servers via stateless operations on resources, often represented as JSON.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "- An API specification defines how APIs behave, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, and error handling. Examples: OpenAPI, Swagger.\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "- Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It’s popular because of its simplicity, flexibility, and built-in development server, making API development fast and easy.\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "- Routing is mapping URLs to functions in Flask. It determines what code runs when a specific URL is accessed.\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "- Creating a simple Flask application involves setting up a web server that listens for HTTP requests and returns responses. Flask provides a minimal and flexible framework that lets you map URLs (routes) to Python functions (view functions). When a user visits a specific URL, Flask routes the request to the corresponding function, which processes the request and returns content—such as text, HTML, or JSON.At its core, a Flask app consists of:\n",
        "- An application instance: This is the main object representing your web app.\n",
        "- Routing definitions: Using decorators, you define which URLs trigger which functions.\n",
        "- View functions: Functions that handle requests and return responses.\n",
        "- A server loop: Flask runs a lightweight development server that listens for requests and dispatches them according to the routing rules.\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "- In RESTful APIs, HTTP methods define the actions clients can perform on resources. The most commonly used methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.\n",
        "-GET is used to retrieve data from the server without modifying it. It’s the method behind reading or fetching resources, such as getting a user’s details or listing products.\n",
        "-POST is used to create new resources by sending data to the server, like adding a new user or submitting a form. When you want to update an entire existing resource.\n",
        "-you use PUT, which replaces the resource with the new data you provide. For partial updates—changing just a few fields without replacing the whole resource—PATCH is the preferred method.\n",
        "-DELETE removes a resource from the server, such as deleting a user account or removing an item from a catalog.\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "- It binds a URL to a function, defining the endpoint route for a specific HTTP method.\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "- GET retrieves data and passes parameters in the URL.\n",
        "- POST sends data in the request body, typically used for creating or updating resources.\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "- Flask APIs involves intercepting situations where the application cannot fulfill a client’s request as expected, and then returning clear, informative responses. Flask provides mechanisms to catch errors—such as missing resources or server failures—and map them to appropriate HTTP status codes like 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error). By defining error handlers, developers can customize these responses, often returning structured JSON messages that clients can understand and act upon. Additionally, Flask allows developers to explicitly trigger errors when certain conditions aren’t met, helping maintain robust and predictable API behavior. Overall, proper error handling in Flask ensures that APIs communicate problems gracefully, improving client experience and aiding debugging.\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "- Connecting Flask to a SQL database means establishing a bridge between your web application and the database so that your app can store, retrieve, update, and delete data dynamically. Flask itself doesn’t directly handle database communication, but through extensions like SQLAlchemy, it gains the ability to translate Python objects into database rows and vice versa. This abstraction simplifies database operations, allows for cleaner code, and supports multiple database backends by just changing configuration. The connection process involves configuring the app with database credentials, defining data models representing tables, and managing sessions that handle transactions safely.\n",
        "11.  What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "- Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that integrates the SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask applications. It simplifies database configuration and connection management within Flask. Developers define Python classes as models representing database tables. It handles sessions and transactions automatically, making CRUD operations easier. Overall, it streamlines working with SQL databases in Flask by combining Flask’s simplicity with SQLAlchemy’s power.\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "- Blueprints allow modular Flask apps by separating routes and logic into components.\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "- Flask’s request object represents the incoming HTTP request from the client. Its purpose is to provide easy access to all the data sent by the client, such as URL parameters, form data, JSON payloads, headers, cookies, and files. It lets your Flask app inspect and handle user input, enabling dynamic responses based on the request content. Essentially, the request object is how Flask reads what the client is asking or sending.\n",
        "14.  How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "- To create a RESTful API endpoint in Flask, you follow these steps:\n",
        " - Import Flask and necessary modules\n",
        " - Create a Flask app instance\n",
        " - Define a route with @app.route() specifying the URL and HTTP methods\n",
        " - Write a view function that processes the request and returns a response (usually JSON)\n",
        " - Run the Flask app\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "- It converts Python dictionaries to a JSON response with proper content-type.\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        "- Flask’s url_for() function generates a URL for a given view function name dynamically. Instead of hardcoding URLs, you use url_for() to build links based on the function that handles a route, which makes your code more flexible and maintainable. It can also accept arguments to fill in variable parts of the URL or add query parameters. This ensures URLs stay consistent even if routes change, helping avoid broken links in your app.\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "- Place them in a /static folder. Access via /static/filename.\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "- An API specification is a formal, structured document that describes how an API works — detailing its endpoints, request methods, parameters, data formats, authentication, and expected responses. It acts as a blueprint or contract between the API provider and consumers, ensuring everyone understands how to interact with the API correctly.\n",
        "-In building a Flask API, an API specification helps by providing clear guidelines for designing endpoints, standardizing input/output formats (like JSON), and defining error handling. It improves development efficiency, facilitates communication between frontend and backend teams, and supports automated testing and documentation generation. Essentially, an API specification ensures your Flask API is consistent, predictable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "- HTTP status codes are standardized numerical codes sent by a server in response to a client’s HTTP request. They indicate the result of the request—whether it was successful, if there was an error, or if further action is needed.\n",
        "-In a Flask API, status codes are important because they communicate the outcome of API calls clearly to clients. For example, 200 means success, 201 means a resource was created, 400 indicates a bad request from the client, and 404 means the requested resource wasn’t found. Using appropriate status codes helps clients handle responses correctly, improves debugging, and makes your API more reliable and user-friendly.\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "- To handle POST requests in Flask, you define a route using the @app.route() decorator and specify the methods=['POST'] argument. Inside the view function, you use Flask’s request object to access the data sent by the client (form data, JSON, etc.).\n",
        "21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "- Authentication and Authorization:Use mechanisms like API keys, OAuth, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. Authorization ensures users only access resources they’re allowed to.\n",
        "-Input Validation and Sanitization:Always validate and sanitize incoming data using libraries like marshmallow or built-in checks to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.\n",
        "-HTTPS:Serve your API over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n",
        "-Rate Limiting:Use tools like Flask-Limiter to restrict the number of requests from a client, protecting against abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n",
        "-Error Handling:Avoid exposing sensitive server information in error messages. Return generic error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.\n",
        "-CORS Configuration:Use Flask-CORS to control which domains are allowed to access your API, especially for browser-based apps.\n",
        "-Secure Headers:Add HTTP security headers using packages like Flask-Talisman to protect against common web vulnerabilities.\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "- It simplifies building REST APIs with resource classes and request parsing.\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "- It stores user-specific data across requests using secure cookies.\n"
